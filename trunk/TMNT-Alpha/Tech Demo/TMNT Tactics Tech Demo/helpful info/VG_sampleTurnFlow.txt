A DESCRIPTION OF ONE PLAYER TURN...THE FLOW:
............................................

user will be notified that it's their turn.

<<will a turtle be selected by default?>>
<<will an enemy be selected by default?>>

the top left character panel will populate with the currently selected turtle's info.

they may select one of their characters at any time, to notify them, change the cursor when hovering over a turtle.
When a turtle is selected, show the range of movement by some visual queue which may be easily distinguished from a visual queue for the attack range. Show that that turtle is selected on the map as well (a selection box of some sort).

Also, change the cursor when hovering over an enemy to an appropriate attack cursor.

when an enemy is clicked, the top right panel will populate with their info.

if the player left-clicks on a tile(not inhabited by an enemy), if it is valid, display the path to get there (depending on how difficult shortest path is to find) with a string of dots or something useful (footstep image maybe?). Could also display the cumulative total AP cost along the path.

if an enemy is clicked, somehow show that that character is selected on the map, and populate the top-right character panel. If that enemy is clicked again, if it is in range, the attack will commence, if not, when hovering with the mouse, the cursor will change to a red circle with an 'X', or some sort of no-can-do visual.
