damage to turtles doesn't display when the ninja is on it's last 4 AP (a move then ONE attack),
might not display any of the damage for a last attack actually...

damage to turtles also displays way off on the y sometimes when ninjas attack

ninja movement seems to cause them to attack from more than one range

when shredder attacked he kept doing the attack animation and damage was shown on screen (was doing neg neg (adding)),
but the damage never was added to the character's health. this didn't stop until he moved to somewhere else.

determine why mouse cursor seems a bit off

ninja position doesn't seem to be updating into the m_vCharacters vector sometimes after they move (something to do with the pathfinding?)
